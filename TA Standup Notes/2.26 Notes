-Front end interacting with backend directly is not the right design
-Only use node.js to work for backend 
-Have an endpoint on node.js to return to parameters to the map
-Do not use PHP for client side integration, use node.js
-Database password is exposed in PHP, PHP is totally outdated language
-Map only needs data points, retrieve them through node.js
-Node.js is a middle man between frontend and database in MySQL
-Citing the code, link is good enough
-Any baseline code, show the code in there for tutorials we have used 
-Apply social aspect to our project
