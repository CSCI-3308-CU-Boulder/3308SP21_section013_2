Boulder Nature Guides:

The Boulder Nature Guides Website functions as a travel planner for users in Boulder. It contains hiking trails, ski slopes, and  parks 
in an easy to navigate interactive map. Users can filter what they see, and save their favorite spots to easily revisit them.

The basic layout of the website (GUI) will be written in HTML and CSS. 
The backend handling of data processing and the like will be handled by JavaScript programs. It will be on node.js and will interact with a database.

How to host this site locally:


Here is our attempt at hosting this site on Heroku:
https://github.com/mjk7817/Boulder-Nature-Guides

The challenges we ran into were getting the map to display and having the routing appropriately work. These are challenges we are hoping to address after this class so that people can have access to our work permentantly rather than trying to run the site locally
